AI-supported writing technologies (AISWT) that provide grammatical suggestions, autocomplete sentences, or generate and rewrite
text are now a regular feature integrated into many people’s workflows. However, little is known about how people perceive the
suggestions these tools provide. In this paper, we investigate how Black American users perceive AISWT, motivated by prior findings
in natural language processing that highlight how the underlying large language models can contain racial biases. Using interviews
and observational user studies with 13 Black American users of AISWT, we found a strong tradeoff between the perceived benefits of
using AISWT to enhance their writing style and feeling like “it wasn’t built for us”. Specifically, participants reported AISWT’s failure
to recognize commonly used names and expressions in African American Vernacular English, experiencing its corrections as hurtful
and alienating and fearing it might further minoritize their culture. We end with a reflection on the tension between AISWT that fail
to include Black American culture and language, and AISWT that attempt to mimic it, with attention to accuracy, authenticity, and the
production of social difference.
