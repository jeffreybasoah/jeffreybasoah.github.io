I am a third-year Ph.D. student and [GEM Fellow](https://www.gemfellowship.org/gem-fellowship-program/) in the Department of **Human-Centered Design and Engineering** at the **University of Washington**, specializing in **Human-Computer Interaction** with a focus on **AI fairness**. I am a member of the [Tactile and Tactical (TAT) Design Lab](https://tat-lab.github.io/), under the guidance of [Dr. Daniela Rosner](https://www.hcde.washington.edu/rosner), and the [Wildlab](https://wildlab.cs.washington.edu/), where I am also advised by [Dr. Katharina Reinecke](https://www.cs.washington.edu/people/faculty/reinecke). My work across these labs focuses on exploring **design, technology, and social impact** through interdisciplinary research.

I am deeply invested in promoting responsible AI/ML systems that prioritize **fairness**, **inclusivity**, and **equity**. My research investigates the sociotechnical implications of **race** and **culture** especially in how **intelligent systems** and **automated language technologies** interact with underrepresented communities. Leveraging **inclusive design** and **justice-driven frameworks**, I aim to enhance user experiences with a particular emphasis on **Black American communities**.

<!--
In addition to my academic pursuits, I serve as a board member of [Acquiring Knowledge for Transcendence](https://www.aktcommunity.org/) and design team lead at [A Vision for Engineering Literacy and Access](http://students.washington.edu/avelauw/index.html), both nonprofit organizations dedicated to supporting underrepresented youth in education. My career goal is to establish a research lab that addresses **social disparities in tech design**, ultimately contributing to **data-driven solutions** that mitigate **racial biases** and amplify **diverse voices** within intelligent systems.

**AI and Diasporic Urban Farming**

Diasporic urban farming communities cultivate not only food but also ecological sustainability, ancestral knowledge, and pathways for social and political transformation for Black, Indigenous, and marginalized groups. These collectives operate within resource-limited environments, relying on labor-intensive practices like soil health monitoring, risk management, and crop harvesting.

Our research investigates the intersection of AI technologies and diasporic farming infrastructuresâ€”a critical yet underexplored site in U.S. technological, economic, and agrarian systems. We seek to understand how AI farming technologies engage with or overlook the expertise of minoritarian farmers and whether industry-driven smart agricultural solutions align with the values and practices of minoritarian farming communities.

This research aims to bridge the gap between emerging AI farming solutions and the lived realities of diasporic agricultural communities, ensuring technological advancements respect, integrate, and uplift minoritized knowledge systems.
