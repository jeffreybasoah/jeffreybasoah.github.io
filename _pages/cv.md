**Wildlab x TAT Lab @ University of Washington**<br>
*Graduate Research Assistant (September 2022 – Present)*<br>

* Hopeful Failure: How Collaborative Design Fiction Reimagines AI

  * While AI development is expanding, marginalized communities are often excluded from shaping its future. This study explores how Black American participants envision AI through collaborative storytelling, focusing on hopes, concerns, and social impacts. Using the "Exquisite Tellings" method, we held design fiction workshops with 10 participants, uncovering themes of reliance, autonomy, and cultural nuance in AI. 

    *	This work introduces "Exquisite Tellings," a participatory storytelling method that expands inclusivity in HCI
    *	We identify five engagement axes with AI, blending acceptance and resistance, moving beyond simple optimism or pessimism.
    *	We develop a collective approach to design fiction, balancing individual agency with shared imagination to envision alternative AI futures

* Understanding Black Users' Perceptions of AI-Supported Writing Technology

  * Although much research has examined bias in large language models, studies on how Black American users experience everyday interactions with NLP tools are still emerging. This study explores the expectations, apprehensions, and perceptions of Black American users regarding AI-supported writing technology. We conducted semi-structured virtual interviews with 13 participants, followed by a remote-moderated user study of word processing software (Google Docs) and large language models (ChatGPT).

    *	Our findings document Black American users' experiences with AI-supported writing technologies, complementing existing literature on large language model’s limitations in language technology
    *	Unlike prior studies, our work revealed a novel concern: the potential for the gradual erasure of Black American culture as future generations increasingly depend on AI for information—a critical perspective that has not been thoroughly examined in existing HCI research

**The Sports Analytics Club Program**<br>
*Mixed-Methods Researcher (February 2021 – May 2022)*<br>

* The SPORT-C Intervention: An Integration of Sports, Case-Based Pedagogy and Systems Thinking Learning 

  * The study aimed to integrate sports cases into STEM courses to foster increased student engagement of an underrepresented demographic in the STEM field. 

    *	Designed user surveys utilizing Qualtrics to gather preliminary data on academic engagement, self-efficacy, expectancy, value, and cost to understand influence of sports on students learning experience
    *	Conducted qualitative usability tests with 2 classrooms to assess correlation and impact of sports-related topics in student learning experiences, aligning case development with student feedback 
    *	Communicated survey findings and insights to interdisciplinary team for further evaluation of future case development process, ensuring roadmap addresses all 4 stakeholder goals and relevant metrics are being measured

**Monumental Sports and Entertainment**<br>
*Data Analyst (January 2021 – March 2021)*<br>

* Fired Fairly? Examining Racial Disparities in NCAA Football Coaching Positions 

  * The study addresses a notable racial imbalance in college football, where African Americans constitute nearly 50% of FBS players but hold less than 10% of head coaching positions. 

    *	Applied both classical and exploratory data analysis techniques, including linear regression, binary regression, ANOVA, and T-tests, to perform large-scale complex analysis into whether racial bias was present in firing minority coaches in the NCAA
    *	Employed Minitab to analyze a large-scale longitudinal dataset of 200 NCAA coaches over past decade for hypothesis testing and regression model construction
    *	Communicated findings to 20 MBA Executives in an educational workshop utilizing data visualizations, leading to understanding results of racial bias in hiring minority coaches
